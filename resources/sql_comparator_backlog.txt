Enchancements:

1. Add try/except construction in case of defining non-existent columns/tables.
2. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
3. Implement correct working of table timeout (probably, we should stop query, if timeout falls).
? 4. Great UI refactoring - move different element groups to different classes.
5. UI hangs and disables during comparing DBs. Add modal window with progress bar and some information about
progress of comparing. Probably, we should generate all sql-queries before running and use this queries to calculate
comparing progress.
? 6. Add QSplitters
? 7. Probably remove Schema columns field, and move this data to hardcode.
? 8. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
9. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
10. Implement skip_column QLineEdit as skip_table.
11. If schema of some table differs we should add this table to skip_table list.

Epics:
0. Support dataframe comparing.
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.

MUST!

1. Implement importing diff-results to html.

Support dataframes roadmap:

0. Check correctness of day-summary mode.
1. Check correctness of section-summary mode.
2. Check correctness of detailed mode.
