Enchancements:

1. Add try/except construction in case of defining non-existent columns/tables.
2. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
3. UI hangs and disables during comparing DBs. Add modal window with progress bar and some information about
progress of comparing. Probably, we should generate all sql-queries before running and use this queries to calculate
comparing progress.
? 4. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
5. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
6. If schema of some table differs we should add this table to skip_table list.
7. Fix sendmail.
8. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".

Epics:
0. Support dataframe comparing.
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.

MUST!

1. Implement importing diff-results to html.

Support dataframes roadmap:

0. Check correctness of day-summary mode.
1. Check correctness of section-summary mode.
2. Check correctness of detailed mode.
