Enchancements:

1. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
2. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout ?
3. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
4. Fix sendmail. # probably with configuring on gmail side.
5. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
6. Only first error flag not works.
7. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
8. Implement threads - UI shouldn't hangs on checknig connection to mysql-server.
9. Implement timeout for starting of checking connection to mysql-server.
10. Fix bug with bar_message - compare button enabled, but message in bar is "test disconnected".
11. BUG. Compare button enabled despite prod/test db fields empty.
12. Legacy leads to fail: get rid of prod/test_sql_connection objects in code, replace it with sqlalchemy engines.

Epics:
0. Support dataframe comparing.
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Implement unit tests.

MUST!

1. Implement importing diff-results to html.

Support dataframes roadmap:

0. Check correctness of day-summary mode.
1. Check correctness of section-summary mode.
2. Check correctness of detailed mode.
