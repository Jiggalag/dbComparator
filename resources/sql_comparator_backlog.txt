Enchancements:

1. Fix cutting of schema_label and data_label in progress window.
2. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
? 3. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
4. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
5. If schema of some table differs we should add this table to skip_table list automatically.
6. Fix sendmail.
7. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
8. Only first error flag not works.
9. On progress window fix "Processing"-string. It should be made with different layout to not cut tablenames.
10. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
11. Probably we should fill all connection fields before checking connection.
12. a. Open some presaved config with Ctrl + O.
    b. Open different config with Ctrl + O.
    AR: application crashed.
    ER: application opened new config.
13. Get rid off custom logger.
14. Switch from custom logger to logging module.
15. Add tables with already detected differs to lists "only tables" as disabled elements with tips and to "skip tables"
as a elements, which user cannot exclude from skip-list.
