Enchancements:

1. Fix cutting of schema_label and data_label in progress window.
2. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
? 3. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
4. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
5. If schema of some table differs we should add this table to skip_table list automatically.
6. Fix sendmail.
7. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
8. Only first error flag not works.
9. On progress window fix "Processing"-string. It should be made with different layout to not cut tablenames.
10. Fix broken "only tables" field.
11. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
12. Probably we should fill all connection fields before checking connection.

Epics:
0. Support dataframe comparing.
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.

MUST!

1. Implement importing diff-results to html.

Support dataframes roadmap:

0. Check correctness of day-summary mode.
1. Check correctness of section-summary mode.
2. Check correctness of detailed mode.
