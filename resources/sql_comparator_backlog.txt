Enchancements:

1. Fix cutting of schema_label and data_label in progress window.
2. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
? 3. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
4. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
5. Fix sendmail. # probably with configuring on gmail side.
6. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
7. Only first error flag not works.
8. On progress window fix "Processing"-string. It should be made with different layout to not cut tablenames.
9. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
